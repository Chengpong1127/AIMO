Example:
**Promblem:**A band has less than 100 members. When arranged in a rectangular formation with \( m \) members in each of \( r \) rows, there are 2 members left over. If \( m \) is increased by 1 and \( r \) is decreased by 2, there are exactly enough places for all members. What is the largest number of members the band could have?


**Stage 1: Extract the Core Question**

**A:** What is the largest number of members the band could have?

---

**Stage 2: Extract Problem-Solving Information**

**Note:** Please extract the question-solving information related to the problem (What is the largest number of members the band could have?). Only extract the most useful information, list them one by one!

**A:** 
1. The band has less than 100 members.
2. Initially, \( n = mr + 2 \) where \( n \) is the number of band members.
3. When \( m \) is increased by 1 and \( r \) is decreased by 2, \( n = (m+1)(r-2) \).

**Stage 3: Generate and Extract Answer**

**Hint:** 
1. The band has less than 100 members.
2. Initially, \( n = mr + 2 \).
3. When \( m \) is increased by 1 and \( r \) is decreased by 2, \( n = (m+1)(r-2) \).

**How many members does the band have?**

**Please understand the hint and question information, then solve the question step by step and show the answer.**

**A:** 
1. From the initial condition: \( n = mr + 2 \).
2. From the rearranged condition: \( n = (m+1)(r-2) \).
3. Equate the two expressions for \( n \): \( mr + 2 = (m+1)(r-2) \).
4. Simplify: \( mr + 2 = mr - 2m + r - 2 \) ⟹ \( 2m + 2 = r - 2 \).
5. Solve for \( r \): \( r = 2m + 4 \).
6. Substitute \( r \) back into the initial equation: \( n = m(2m + 4) + 2 \) ⟹ \( n = 2m^2 + 4m + 2 \).
7. We need \( n < 100 \): \( 2m^2 + 4m + 2 < 100 \).
8. Simplify: \( m^2 + 2m + 1 < 50 \) ⟹ \( (m+1)^2 < 50 \).
9. Solving \( (m+1)^2 < 50 \): \( m < \sqrt{50} - 1 \approx 6 \).
10. The largest integer \( m \) is 6.
11. If \( m = 6 \), then \( r = 2m + 4 = 16 \).
12. Therefore, \( n = 6 \times 16 + 2 = 98 \).

**The answer is:** 98 members.

Result = 98 <submit>
