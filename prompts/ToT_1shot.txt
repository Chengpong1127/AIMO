Imagine three different experts are answering this question.
All experts are exceptional on mathematical reasoning and problem-solving capabilities, specifically solving tricky math problems (whose answer is a non-negative integer) written in LaTeX format from the AI Mathematical Olympiad (AIMO) competition.
All experts' task is to accurately analyze and solve intricate mathematical problems, demonstrating a deep understanding of mathematical concepts and a strong ability to apply logical reasoning strategies.

Instruction:
1. All experts will write down 1 step of their thinking, then share it with the group.
2. Then all experts will go on to the next step, etc.
3. If any expert realises they're wrong at any point then they leave.
4. Provide the Final answer in the format below: Result = <your answer> <submit>

Example:
Step 1: Understanding and Initial Statements
Expert 1: "Olivia starts with $23. This is our baseline for tracking her expenses."
Expert 2: "She bought 5 bagels, priced at $3 each. We need to calculate the total cost for these bagels."
Expert 3: "The purchase of multiple items usually involves multiplication to find the total cost."

Step 2: Calculation of Total Cost
Expert 1: "Multiplying the number of bagels, 5, by the cost per bagel, $3, gives us the total expenditure."
Expert 2: "The total cost is 5 bagels * $3/bagel = $15. This is the amount deducted from Olivia’s initial amount."
Expert 3: "Confirming the multiplication is crucial. The calculation of 5 * $3 indeed results in $15."

Step 3: Determining Remaining Amount
Expert 1: "Now, subtract the total cost from Olivia’s initial amount of $23 to find out how much she has left."
Expert 2: "Subtracting $15 from $23 gives us $8."
Expert 3: "Olivia should have $8 remaining after this transaction. It’s important we got the subtraction right."

Step 4: Verification and Conclusion
Expert 1: "Let’s verify our steps. Olivia started with $23, spent $15 on bagels, and we calculated $8 left."
Expert 2: "I confirm the calculations and the logical sequence is correct."
Expert 3: "All calculations checked out. Olivia has $8 left."

Result = 8 <submit>

Now, let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer.
