Your task is to solve the following math problem using a Python interpreter. Follow the steps to write and execute Python code. You need to submit your answer by writing "Result = answer <submit>" where answer is the result of the problem.
Q: Let \\[f(x) = \\left\\{\n\\begin{array}{cl} ax+3, &\\text{ if }x>2, \\\\\nx-5 &\\text{ if } -2 \\le x \\le 2, \\\\\n2x-b &\\text{ if } x <-2.\n\\end{array}\n\\right.\\]Find $a+b$ if the piecewise function is continuous (which means that its graph can be drawn without lifting your pencil from the paper).
A: 

Analysis: For the piecewise function to be continuous, the cases must \"meet\" at $2$ and $-2$. For example, $ax+3$ and $x-5$ must be equal when $x=2$.

<request><PythonInterpreter>
from sympy import symbols, Eq, solve
# Define the variable a
a = symbols('a')
# Define the equation ax + 3 = x - 5 when x = 2
equation = Eq(a*2 + 3, 2 - 5)
# get a
solution = solve(equation, a)
print(solution)
<call>[-3]<response>

Analysis: Now we know that $a = -3$. We can try to find $b$ by setting $x = -2$ and solving the equation $x - 5 = 2x - b$.

<request><PythonInterpreter>
from sympy import symbols, Eq, solve
# Define the variable b
b = symbols('b')
# Define the equation x - 5 = 2x - b when x = -2
equation = Eq(-2 - 5, 2*(-2) - b)
# get b
solution = solve(equation, b)
print(solution)
<call>[3]<response>

Analysis: Now we know that $b = 3$. Combining the results we got $a = -3$ and $b = 3$, we can find $a + b$.

<request><PythonInterpreter>
# Calculate a + b
a = -3
b = 3

result = a + b
print(result)
<call>0<response>

Analysis: Now we know that $a + b = 0$. We can submit the answer.

Result = 0 <submit>

Q: Let $g(n)$ be the product of the proper positive integer divisors of $n$. (Recall that a proper divisor of $n$ is a divisor other than $n$.) For how many values of $n$ does $n$ not divide $g(n)$, given that $2 \le n \le 50$?

A: 

Analysis: If $n$ is prime, then $g(n) = 1$, so $n$ cannot divide $g(n)$. We need to find all primes less than or equal to 50.

<request><PythonInterpreter>
import sympy as sp

# Find all primes less than or equal to 50
primes = list(sp.primerange(2, 51))
print(primes)
<call>[2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47]<response>

Analysis: There are 15 primes less than or equal to 50. Next, we consider the squares of primes.

<request><PythonInterpreter>
import numpy as np

# Find the squares of the primes less than or equal to 50
primes = [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47]
prime_squares = [p**2 for p in primes if p**2 <= 50]
print(prime_squares)
<call>[4, 9, 25, 49]<response>

Analysis: There are 4 prime squares less than or equal to 50. Now we can combine the results.

<request><PythonInterpreter>
# Total number of values of n for which n does not divide g(n)
primes = [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47]
prime_squares = [4, 9, 25, 49]
total_values = len(primes) + len(prime_squares)
print(total_values)
<call>19<response>

Analysis: Now we know that there are 19 values of n for which n does not divide g(n). We can submit the answer.

Result = 19 <submit>
