**Math Problem:**
There exists a unique increasing geometric sequence of five 2-digit positive integers. What is their sum?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Define the sequence:**
   \( a, ar, ar^2, ar^3, ar^4 \) where \( a \) is the first term and \( r \) is the common ratio ( \( r > 1 \) ).

2. **Range constraints:**
   \( 10 \leq a, ar, ar^2, ar^3, ar^4 \leq 99 \).

3. **Determine \( a \) and \( r \):**
   \( r \) must be rational and all terms must be integers.

4. **Check possible values:**
   - Test feasible \( r \) values.
   - \( r = 3/2 \), \( a = 16 \) yields \( 16, 24, 36, 54, 81 \).

5. **Calculate the sum:**
   Sum = 16 + 24 + 36 + 54 + 81 = 211

6. **Submit the answer:**
   Result = 211 <submit>

Now, let's think the problem in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer.
