**Math Problem:**
There exists a unique increasing geometric sequence of five 2-digit positive integers. What is their sum?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Define the sequence:** 
   Let the five terms be \( a, ar, ar^2, ar^3, ar^4 \), where \( a \) is the first term and \( r \) is the common ratio ( \( r > 1 \) ).

2. **Identify the range:**
   Since all terms must be 2-digit integers, \( 10 \leq a \leq 99 \). Additionally, \( ar, ar^2, ar^3, ar^4 \) must also lie between 10 and 99.

3. **Determine constraints:**
   For \( ar \) to be a 2-digit integer, \( 10 \leq ar \leq 99 \). Similarly, \( 10 \leq ar^2 \leq 99 \). Continue this process up to \( ar^4 \).

4. **Find possible values of \( a \) and \( r \):**
   Since the sequence is geometric and all terms must be integers, \( r \) must be a rational number that maintains integer values throughout the sequence.

5. **Check for possible values manually:**
   Let's test common ratios and find a sequence that fits:
   - If \( r = 2 \): Sequence: \( 10, 20, 40, 80, 160 \) (not all terms are 2-digit).
   - Continue testing higher \( a \) and feasible \( r \) values until a valid sequence is found.

6. **Identify the unique sequence:**
   Through this process, we find \( a = 16 \) and \( r = 3/2 \):
   Sequence: \( 16, 24, 36, 54, 81 \) fits all constraints.

7. **Calculate the sum:**
   Sum = 16 + 24 + 36 + 54 + 81

8. **Final calculation:**
   Sum = 211

9. **Submit the answer:**
   Result = 211 <submit>

Now, let's think the problem in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer.
